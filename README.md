# Notscilloscope
An open source (not-)oscilloscope running on an Arduino with LCD display. Continuously plots the data from an analog port on a Nokia 5110-style graphic LCD display. 2 potentiometers can change the value that centers the Y axis and the amplitude. A button auto selects the best center and amplitude based on recent data history.
